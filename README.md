# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-System
ABSTRACT :-
Road accidents are a major cause of deaths, injuries and property damage every year.
Various reports by the World Health Organisation (WHO) indicate that the total
number of road traffic deaths across the world has plateaued at 1.25 million per year,
with the highest fatality rates in low and middle-income countries. Drowsy and
fatigued drivers are often attributed to be responsible for this deplorable situation.
The development of technologies for detecting & preventing drowsiness at the wheel
has thus become a major challenge in the field of accident avoidance systems.
Because of the hazard that drowsiness presents on the road, methods need to be
developed for counteracting its affects. Our project does the same.
The aim of this project is to develop a prototype drowsiness detection system. The
focus will be placed on designing a system that will accurately monitor the open or
closed state of the driverâ€™s eyes in real-time using OpenCV. The system will monitor
the driver's eye movements & blink patterns using a camera. A warning alarm will
be issued if a prolonged blink is observed.
This whole system can be deployed on portable hardware in the near future which
could be easily installed in the car for use. The project will thus be able to lower the
risk of fatal road accidents to a great extent.

TECHNOLOGY USED:-
1. OpenCV(Python)
2. Dlib
3. PyCharm IDE
